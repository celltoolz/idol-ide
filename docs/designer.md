# GUI Designer

IDOL includes a full **VB6-style drag-and-drop GUI builder** for Tkinter applications — the only Python IDE with a visual form designer built in.

> **Activation:** The Designer only appears for **Tkinter GUI App** projects. Create one with `File → New Project…` and select **Tkinter GUI App** — the wizard scaffolds `Form1.py`, `Form1.form.json`, and a `main.py` entry point, then drops you straight into the canvas.

## Layout

```

Entering Designer mode swaps the File Explorer out and the Widget Palette in — same left-panel slot, no floating windows. The left panel is split: the **FORMS tree** sits at the top, and the **Widget Palette** fills the rest. Exiting Designer restores the Explorer.

## Canvas

- **Dotted-grid design surface** — form rendered at real size with a simulated title bar and drop shadow
- **Widgets render realistically** — relief styles (raised, sunken, groove, ridge, solid, flat), disabled state, password dots, progress bars, checked checkboxes, and more; changing the `relief` property in the Properties panel updates the canvas immediately
- **Click to select** — blue dashed border + 8 white resize handles appear on the selected widget
- **Click the title bar** — selects the form and reveals its resize handles (dashed border + 8 corner/edge handles)
- **Drag to move** — repositions with 8px snap-to-grid; hold **Shift** while dragging for 1px precision
- **Drag a handle to resize** — snapped to the same 8px grid; hold **Shift** for 1px precision
- **Multi-select** — rubber-band drag to select multiple widgets; Ctrl+Click to toggle individual widgets; drag the group to move all at once
- **Primary vs secondary selection** — the last-clicked widget is the primary (amber border + full resize handles); all others are secondary (blue border only); resize dragging on any handle propagates the delta to all selected widgets
- **Copy / Paste** — Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V to duplicate; right-click context menu with Copy, Paste, Delete, Bring to Front, Send to Back
- **Arrow-key nudge** — 8px nudge (matching the snap grid) with arrow keys; hold **Shift** for 1px precision
- **Z-order** — Bring to Front / Send to Back preserved on every mutation
- **Menu bar strip** — live menu bar rendered below the title bar from your menu items; clicking a top-level name opens a native dropdown; clicking a command or check/radio item with a handler navigates to that handler in the editor
- **Canvas scrollbars** — the canvas has horizontal and vertical scrollbars with mousewheel support on all platforms (Windows/macOS via `<MouseWheel>`; Linux via `<Button-4>`/`<Button-5>`; hold **Shift** to scroll horizontally); the form recenters automatically after a resize drag

## Widget Palette

17 widget types in a scrollable toolbox with canvas-drawn mini-previews:

Button, Label, Entry, Text, Checkbutton, Radiobutton, Combobox, Listbox, **Treeview**, Frame, LabelFrame, **Notebook**, Scale, Spinbox, Progressbar, Separator, **Canvas**

**Placement modes:**
- **Click** — arms the crosshair tool; click anywhere on the canvas to drop at default size
- **Click-and-drag on canvas** — after arming, drag out a bounding box on the canvas; the widget is placed at exactly the drawn size (grid-snapped, 16px minimum); hold **Shift** while dragging to place at exact pixel size (1px minimum); a plain click without dragging still drops at default size
- **Drag from palette to canvas** — drag a palette item directly onto the canvas; a ghost label follows the cursor; releasing over the canvas drops the widget at default size at that position; releasing outside the canvas cancels
- **Double-click** — places the widget at the centre of the form immediately, without needing a canvas click

**Multi-placement mode** — a single click on a palette item keeps the tool armed after each drop. Every subsequent canvas click places another widget of the same type. De-arm by pressing Escape, clicking outside the canvas, or selecting the Pointer tool.

**Smart placement cursor** — while a palette tool is armed, the cursor changes based on what's under it:
- **Crosshair** over empty form area — click will place a new widget
- **Arrow** over an unselected widget — click selects it and de-arms the tool
- **Fleur (move)** over a selected widget — drag moves it immediately; click selects and de-arms

## Toolbar

A horizontal strip above the canvas with alignment, snap, and history controls.

**Left cluster — Alignment** (requires ≥2 selected):
- Align Left, Right, Top, Bottom, Center Horizontally, Center Vertically

**Center cluster — Distribution** (requires ≥3 selected):
- Distribute Equal Horizontal / Vertical spacing — grid-aware: clusters widgets into rows/columns and assigns uniform positions

**Center cluster — Sizing** (requires ≥2 selected):
- Same Width / Same Height across all selected widgets

**Snap toggle** — enable/disable snap-to-grid (8px); blue indicator when active. Hold **Shift** at any time while the canvas has focus to temporarily disable snap — the button dims immediately on key-down and restores on key-up (works during move, resize, form resize, and widget draw)

**Grid Layout popup** — ⊡ button opens a `Toplevel` with Make Grid and H/V nudge controls for arranging widgets in a regular grid automatically; H/V nudge buttons step by 8px, or **1px when Shift is held**

**Show/hide grid** — `⋯` toggle button shows or hides the dot grid on the canvas; defaults on; lit blue when active

**Tab order toggle** — `⇥` button shows or hides numbered blue badges on every widget indicating its tab/z-order position; toggles as a sticky button (lit blue when active)

**Right cluster — History & Clipboard:**

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Undo | Ctrl+Z |
| Redo | Ctrl+Y |
| Copy | Ctrl+C |
| Paste | Ctrl+V |

Undo/Redo is snapshot-based (max 50 states). Every mutation — move, resize, add, delete, prop change — is snapshotted before it happens. Also accessible via right-click context menu on the canvas.

**Toolbar button states** — buttons dim to #555555 and ignore clicks when their action doesn't apply (alignment/distribute/size require ≥2/3 widgets selected; undo/redo track stack depth; copy requires a selection; paste requires clipboard content).

## Properties Panel

Right-side panel with a **control selector dropdown** at the top and Property/Value columns below. Click any value to edit inline; geometry updates live as you drag on the canvas.

### Font Picker

The `font` property row opens a font chooser dialog pre-populated with the widget's current family, size, and style. Supports bold, italic, underline, and overstrike. The chosen font is stored as a `"Family size style"` string (e.g. `"Arial 12 bold"`) and emitted in generated code as a font **tuple** — `('Segoe UI', 12, 'bold')` — so multi-word family names (Segoe UI, Times New Roman, …) are valid; a bare spaced-family string would otherwise be parsed by Tk as a list and crash with `expected integer`.

### Color Picker
Background and Foreground properties open `tkinter.colorchooser`. The row tints immediately and the canvas widget updates live. Non-input widgets (Button, Label, Frame, etc.) start with no explicit background color, inheriting the OS default. Input widgets (Entry, Text, Listbox) default to white. A `×` button appears on hover to clear a color back to the OS default.

### State
Button, Entry, Text, Combobox, and other widgets expose a `state` dropdown (normal / readonly / disabled). Selecting readonly or disabled reveals conditional color rows (`readonlybackground`, `disabledbackground`, `disabledforeground`) that auto-fill with defaults and hide when not applicable.

### Validation
Entry and Spinbox expose a `validate` dropdown (key / focus / all / etc.) with `--vcmd`, `--args`, and `--ivcmd` sub-rows. The `--args` field has a preset dropdown for common tkinter substitution codes (`%P`, `%P, %S`, etc.). Codegen emits `self.register(self.method)` wiring automatically.

Hovering a substitution code in the `--args` dropdown shows its meaning in the hint bar at the bottom of the Properties panel (e.g. `%P` → *proposed value after the edit*, `%S` → *string being inserted or deleted*, `%d` → *action type: 0=delete 1=insert*).

### Variable Binding
Supported widgets expose a Variable section: set a name, type (StringVar / IntVar / DoubleVar / BooleanVar), and initial value. Codegen emits the declaration and wires `textvariable=` / `variable=` automatically.

**Variable picker popup** — click the variable name field to open a popup listing every variable defined on the form (from widget bindings and menu check/radio items) with its type; live-filters as you type, or type a new name manually.

### Widget Anchoring

The `anchor` row in Properties shows a 3×3 picker grid. Selecting an anchor position (e.g. bottom-right) causes the widget to reposition and resize relative to the form at runtime — so it stays pinned to that corner as the window is resized.

- **Live preview** — while you drag a form resize handle on the canvas, anchored widgets reposition in real time, matching the runtime behavior
- **Shift+resize suppresses anchors** — hold Shift while dragging a form handle to keep all widgets frozen (useful for checking the layout without anchor interference)
- **Hover hint** — the anchor row's status-bar hint describes the selected anchor and reminds you of the Shift shortcut
- A `×` button appears on hover to clear the anchor back to none

Codegen emits a `_apply_anchor_layout()` method that is called in `__init__` after `_build_ui()`.

### Multi-Select Properties

When multiple widgets are selected, the Properties panel shows the **intersection** of all their shared property names. Values that differ across the selection are shown blank; typing a new value applies it to all selected widgets at once. Color pickers, enum dropdowns, and text fields all work in multi-select. The font picker and list editor are single-select only.

### Image Properties

Label, Button, and Canvas widgets support an `image` property. Click the row to open a file picker — the selected file is automatically copied into `<project>/images/` so the generated app is self-contained. A live thumbnail scaled to the widget bounds appears on the canvas immediately.

- **Compound** (Label and Button only) — positions the image relative to any text: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, `center`, `none`; when an image is set the canvas hides the text label to match runtime behaviour
- **PIL warning row** — if Pillow is not installed in the active project interpreter, an amber **⚠ click to install Pillow** row appears below the `image` row; clicking it streams `pip install pillow` into the Output panel and removes the warning on success
- **Anchor-aware resize** — when the widget has a size-changing anchor (`all`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`), codegen emits a `<Configure>` binding that reloads the `PhotoImage` at the new widget dimensions so the image scales live with the window

### Canvas Widget Properties

The **Canvas** widget (the drawing surface — distinct from the design canvas) has a few extra properties:

- **`sizing`** — `sizable` (default): the canvas fills its placed bounds and can be resized freely. `fit image`: the canvas locks to the natural pixel dimensions of its background image and resize handles are disabled. Setting a background image defaults `sizing` to `sizable`; choosing **fit image** snaps the widget to the image size.
- **`highlightthickness`** and **`bd`** — integer border controls (the old True/False `border` prop was split into these two). Both default to `0` so a freshly dropped Canvas has no highlight ring or border.
- **Canvas items** — shapes, text, lines, and images placed inside the canvas are managed in the [Canvas Item Designer](#canvas-item-designer) (double-click the canvas), not the Properties panel.

### Form Properties
Click the canvas background to inspect the form: title, size, background color, border style (Sizable / Fixed / None), maximize box, and **always on top** (pins the window above all other windows). Border style and maximize box stay in sync automatically.

**Background image** — the `image` row on the form opens a file picker. The selected file is copied to `<project>/images/` and rendered at natural size on the designer canvas, sitting behind the dot grid. Hovering the row shows the filename plus its pixel dimensions. A `×` button clears the image. Codegen emits a `tk.Label` placed at (0, 0) as the first child in `_build_ui` so all other widgets render on top. Requires Pillow — an amber warning row appears if Pillow is not installed.

### Menu Bar
A `menu bar` row in form properties opens the **Menu Editor** — see [Menu Editor](#menu-editor) below.

### Hover Interactions
- Mousing over any row highlights it in blue
- Color props and optional props show a `×` button on hover to clear back to default
- A short description of each property appears in the status bar as you hover

## Events Tab

Every widget exposes its full event list (click, dblclick, keypress, focusin, change, and more).

- **Click the value column** (right of the name/value split) to open the handler picker or type a custom name; clicking the name column alone does nothing
- **Double-click a wired row** to jump directly to that handler in the editor (auto-generates code first if dirty)
- Handler names that don't start with `_` are flagged red — non-underscore names go to the Functions section instead of the Events stub section
- Wired rows show a `×` button on hover to clear the handler
- **✦ auto-wire button** appears on hover for unwired rows
- **? Events** row at the bottom opens a paginated guide explaining events, wiring steps, naming conventions, and a full reference table for the selected widget type
- **Canvas widget** — when a Canvas widget has image buttons configured via an [Image component](#image), the Events tab shows additional **read-only** rows for each `tag_bind` generated: `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and (if hover is configured) `mouseenter` / `mouseleave`. These rows are greyed out; use the Image Button Builder to change them.

**`command` event** — for Button, Checkbutton, Radiobutton, Scale, Spinbox this generates `command=self.method` as a constructor kwarg (not `.bind()`).

**`comboselected` event** — for Combobox, generates `.bind("<<ComboboxSelected>>", ...)`.

**Form events** — clicking the canvas background and switching to the Events tab exposes form-level events: load, activate, deactivate, unload, resize. Wiring them generates `.bind()` calls and stubs the handler methods.

**Handler picker** — every event handler cell has a ▾ button that opens a scrollable popup listing all handlers already defined on the form. Hover a row to preview the name in the entry field. Useful for reusing an existing handler across multiple events. The Menu Editor Command field has the same picker.

**Component connections in the Events tab** — when a non-visual component is selected, the Events tab lists the widget events its handlers are wired to (`comp_wire` rows). Each wired row has a dedicated **edit** button, and a `···` button opens the **Connect Widget Events** dialog to add or re-target a connection without leaving the tab.

## Handlers Tab

The **Handlers** tab shows every method IDOL can generate and lets you wire connectable handlers to widget events. It uses an **Available / Connected** split — no checkboxes.

### Available Section

Handlers that are not yet wired or enabled. A **⚡** button appears on hover:

- **Connectable handler** (e.g. `open_dialog`, `always_on_top`) — clicking ⚡ opens the **Connector** dialog where you pick a widget and an event; the wire is stored and the handler moves to Connected
- **Non-connectable handler** (e.g. `on_escape`, `on_return`) — clicking ⚡ enables it immediately; the handler appears in Connected wired to its built-in target

**`multi_wire` handlers** (currently `open_dialog`) stay in Available even after wiring so you can wire them to additional widget events — one wire per dialog.

**Available Components sub-section** — collapsed by default (▶ header); click the header to expand. Shows **all** connectable component handlers (e.g. `timer1_start`, `cd1_show_open`) regardless of whether they are already wired — handlers are reusable and can be connected to multiple widgets or menu items. Clicking ⚡ opens the Connector pre-selecting the current widget.

### Connected Section

Enabled or wired handlers, each showing their target on the right (e.g. `btn1.click` or `WM_DELETE_WINDOW`). Two floating buttons appear on hover:

- **×** — disconnects the wire or disables the handler
- **…** — opens the **Options Editor** for handlers that have named mode variants (e.g. `on_close` with hide vs destroy, `open_dialog` close-mode picker)

**⚡ Connected Components sub-section** (widget-selected only) — component handler methods already wired to this widget's events or menu items; **×** to disconnect, **…** to edit the wire or per-handler properties (dialog title, messagebox type and message, etc.).

### Options Editor

When a connected handler has named mode variants, the **…** button opens a picker with two-line rows — bold option name on line 1, orange description on line 2. Selecting an option updates the stub body or wire body and (for `open_dialog`) syncs the linked dialog's `_on_close` mode.

### open_dialog Handler

`open_dialog` (main forms only) wires a widget event to open a linked dialog. The Connector shows two dropdowns:

- **Dialog** — which linked dialog to open
- **Mode** — **hide (withdraw)** reuses the instance on next open; **destroy (exit)** recreates it fresh

Wiring automatically updates the linked dialog's `_on_close` option to match the chosen mode. Use the **…** button on a connected row to change the mode later — the dialog's `_on_close` updates automatically.

### When the Form is Selected

Both Available and Connected sections show all form-level handlers together with all component handlers from the tray, giving a full picture of what the form generates.

## Order Tab

The **Order** tab in the Properties panel shows all widgets on the form as a canvas-rendered numbered list in their current tab/z-order.

- Drag any row up or down to reorder it — the canvas updates immediately, badges refresh, and undo is supported
- The order here is both the **Tab key focus sequence** and the **z-order** (earlier entries are beneath later ones)
- The **`⇥` toolbar button** toggles numbered blue badges directly on the canvas widgets so you can see the order at a glance without switching to the Order tab
- A permanent hint in the status bar reminds you of what the Order tab does when it is active

**Notebook tab grouping** — when the form contains a Notebook, its children appear indented under teal tab-header rows (one per tab, in the Notebook's `tabs` property order). Dragging a child row across a tab header reassigns it to that tab — the canvas and codegen update automatically. Tab order badges are numbered independently within each tab.

## Widget Containment

Frame, LabelFrame, and Notebook act as parent containers:

- **Dropping or drawing** a widget onto a container auto-parents it (coordinates stored relative to the container's content area, matching how tkinter's `place()` works); children are clamped to the container bounds on drop
- Drag a widget out of a container to reparent it to the form or another container
- The `parent` row in Properties is read-only — drag on the canvas to reparent
- LabelFrame applies a 17px label-area offset automatically
- Codegen uses the container as the parent argument for `place()`
- **Deleting** a container removes all of its descendant widgets

## Notebook Widget

`ttk.Notebook` is a first-class container in the designer — drop it onto the canvas, then add widgets to each of its tabs.

- The canvas renders the tab strip with the active tab raised and inactive tabs dimmed, matching the native ttk.Notebook appearance
- **Switching tabs** on the canvas (click a tab label) selects the Notebook widget, clears resize handles, and shows/hides children so only the active tab's content is visible
- **Adding children** — with a palette tool armed, hover over the Notebook's content area; the cursor changes to a crosshair; dropping or drawing places the widget inside the active tab
- Each child has a `tab` property (the tab name string) that determines which tab it belongs to; reassign via the Order tab or by dragging across tab headers
- The **`<<NotebookTabChanged>>`** event is available in the Events tab; wiring it generates a `.bind()` call and a handler stub
- Codegen emits the full Notebook hierarchy: `ttk.Notebook`, one `ttk.Frame` per tab added with `.add(frame, text="Tab Name")`, and child widgets placed inside their tab's frame

## Treeview Widget

`ttk.Treeview` is a multi-column list / tree widget. Drop it onto the canvas and configure it from the Properties panel:

- **`columns`** — clicking the row opens the **Column Editor** dialog. Each column has an **ID** (the tkinter identifier — leave blank to auto-derive a stable slug from the heading), a **Heading** (display text), a **Width** (px), an **Anchor** (`left`/`center`/`right` → `w`/`center`/`e`), and a **Stretch** toggle. Rows can be added, reordered (↑ ↓), and removed (×). Column ids stay stable when you rename a heading, so user code that references a column by id keeps working.
- **`rows`** — clicking the row opens the **Row Editor** dialog: seed rows inserted at startup. Its grid is derived from the current columns — a `(tree)` cell for the `#0` label when `show` includes the tree column, then one cell per data column. Add / reorder / remove rows. Rows are stored as `{text, values}` dicts; cells are padded/truncated to the column count automatically. Like Listbox `values`, these are seed data — clear or replace them in code at runtime.
- **`tree heading`** — heading text for the implicit tree column (`#0`). Only shown/applied when `show` includes the tree column.
- **`show`** — `tree headings` (the `#0` tree column plus data columns), `headings` (data columns only — the flat-table look), or `tree` (the tree column only).
- **`selectmode`** — `browse` (single), `extended` (multi), or `none`.
- **`scrollbar`** — `None` / `Vertical` / `Horizontal` / `Both`; enabling one wraps the Treeview in a Frame with `ttk.Scrollbar`(s) wired to `yview`/`xview`, exactly like the other scrollable widgets.

The `columns` prop is stored as a list of dicts (`{id, heading, width, anchor, stretch}`); legacy plain-string column lists are auto-migrated on load by `normalize_tree_columns()`.

The canvas renders a representative preview: a heading strip (when headings are shown), a `#0` tree column when applicable (proportioned by the configured widths), and three sample rows with the first row selected.

**Events** — `treeselect` (`<<TreeviewSelect>>`), `treeopen` (`<<TreeviewOpen>>`), and `treeclose` (`<<TreeviewClose>>`) are available in the Events tab; wiring one generates a `.bind()` call and a handler stub.

Codegen emits the `ttk.Treeview` constructor with the column **ids** in `columns=(…)`, plus `show`/`selectmode`, followed by per-column `heading(text=…)` and `column(width=…, anchor=…, stretch=…)` calls (and a `heading("#0", …)` when a tree heading is set), then a `insert("", "end", text=…, values=(…))` call for each seed row — all after placement. `text=` is emitted only when the tree column is shown.

## Menu Editor

A VB6-style dialog accessible from the `menu bar` form property row.

**Fields:** Caption, Name, Shortcut, Enabled, Visible, **Type** (Command / Checkbutton / Radiobutton), **Variable** (with variable picker popup), **Command** (with handler picker popup), **Value**

**Controls:** ← → ↑ ↓ arrow buttons to indent (create submenus) and reorder; Insert / **Separator** / Delete / Next; indented preview listbox; hover hint bar at the bottom describing each field; OK / Cancel

**& access-key in captions** — prefix a letter with `&` (e.g. `&File`) to set an access-key underline. The `&` is stripped from the rendered caption and codegen emits the matching `underline=N` kwarg.

**Behavior:**
- Adding a menu bar shifts all top-level widgets down 20px and increases form height; removing reverses this
- Live menu bar strip rendered on canvas below the title bar
- Codegen emits the full `tk.Menu` hierarchy — `add_checkbutton`/`add_radiobutton` for check/radio items with `variable=`, `value=`, and `command=` kwargs; auto-stubs all leaf command handlers; emits `BooleanVar`/`StringVar` declarations for menu variables; emits `self.bind("<shortcut>", handler)` for items with both a shortcut and a handler

## Non-Visual Components

Non-visual components (timers, dialogs, file pickers) live in the **component tray** — a chip strip below the canvas. Click the **COMPONENTS** palette section to add one; the tray shows icon + name chips; selecting a chip reveals its properties and handlers in the Properties / Handlers panels. Codegen emits init code and all handler stubs into the generated `.py`; user bodies survive regeneration automatically.

**Wiring connectable handlers** — handlers marked ⚡ can be wired to widget events or menu items via the [Connector](#handlers-tab). The Connector lists both widget events and any non-cascade command menu items so a single handler can be invoked from a button click, a keyboard shortcut, or a menu command — no extra wrapper code needed.

**Menu item wiring** — wiring a component handler to a menu item stores the method reference directly on the menu item (`command_handler`); codegen emits `command=self._cd1_show_open` instead of the default `_{name}_click` wrapper.

**Selective imports** — codegen only emits dialog imports your form actually uses (e.g. `from tkinter import filedialog` appears only if `_show_open` or `_show_save` is wired; `messagebox` only if `_show_message` is wired).

### Image

Named image references loaded in `__init__` — not a visible widget, just a Python object that holds one or more `ImageTk.PhotoImage` values that your code can use anywhere.

**Adding images** — click the `images` property row to open a multi-select file picker. All selected files are copied to `<project>/images/`. The number of files selected determines the generated code shape:

| Files selected | Generated code |
|---|---|
| 1 | `self.name = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open(...))` |
| 2+ | `self.name = {"stem": ImageTk.PhotoImage(...), ...}` keyed by filename stem |

**Tray chip** — shows a live thumbnail of the first image; multi-image groups show a `×N` badge. Hovering the chip opens a gallery popup (400 ms delay) showing 80 px thumbnails with key names for every image in the group.

#### Canvas Button handler (`canvas_button` ⚡)

The `canvas_button` handler places an image-based clickable button on any `tk.Canvas` widget. Click ⚡ to open the **Image Button Builder**:

- **Canvas** — pick an existing Canvas widget or choose `＋ Create New Canvas` (a new Canvas is created on the form automatically)
- **Normal / Hover / Pressed** — choose which image key to display in each state. Hover and Pressed are optional; omitting Hover skips `<Enter>`/`<Leave>` bindings.
- **Position** — X and Y coordinates within the canvas
- **Tag name** — auto-generated from `{comp_id}_{canvas_id}`; must be unique per canvas
- **Auto-size canvas** — checked by default; reads PIL dimensions of all images in the component and resizes the target Canvas widget to the largest width × height
- **Live preview** — the preview pane shows the actual image and responds to clicks so you can verify the normal/pressed/hover states before confirming

**Designer canvas preview** — once a canvas button is configured, the designer renders the normal image at the configured position on the Canvas widget as a ghost, with a dim tag-name label.

**Connected display** — canvas buttons appear in the Connected section in both the Image component's Handlers tab (`canvas1 · btn_tag`) and the Canvas widget's Handlers tab. Clicking ✏ on either side reopens the builder pre-filled with the existing config; × deletes the button and its generated code.

**Generated code shape:**

```python
# _build_ui — placement + bindings
self.canvas1.create_image(50, 80, image=self.dragon["idle"], anchor="nw", tags="btn_attack")
self.canvas1.tag_bind("btn_attack", "<Button-1>",        self._btn_attack_down)
self.canvas1.tag_bind("btn_attack", "<ButtonRelease-1>", self._btn_attack_up)
self.canvas1.tag_bind("btn_attack", "<Enter>",           self._btn_attack_enter)  # if hover
self.canvas1.tag_bind("btn_attack", "<Leave>",           self._btn_attack_leave)  # if hover

# Generated (always overwritten — do not edit directly)
def _btn_attack_down(self, event): ...   # swap to pressed image
def _btn_attack_up(self, event):   ...   # swap back, then call _btn_attack_click
def _btn_attack_enter(self, event): ...  # swap to hover image
def _btn_attack_leave(self, event): ...  # swap back to normal

# User stub (never overwritten — put your click logic here)
def _btn_attack_click(self, event):
    pass  # TODO
```

One Image component can power multiple canvas buttons on the same or different canvases — each ⚡ click adds another wire.

### Timer

`self.after()` periodic callback — no threading, no locks.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| Interval | Milliseconds between ticks |
| Enabled | Start timer on form load |

| Handler | Description |
|---|---|
| `_tick` | User logic; called every interval |
| `_start` ⚡ | Start the timer; wire to a button or menu item |
| `_stop` ⚡ | Stop the timer |

### Socket

TCP socket component — **Server** listens for incoming connections; **Client** connects to a remote host. All network I/O runs on daemon threads; callbacks dispatch back to the main thread via `self.after(0, ...)` so tkinter widgets are always updated safely.

**Setup dialog** — dropping a Socket from the palette immediately shows a setup dialog:
- **Type** — Server or Client
- **Host / Port** — remote host (client) or bind address (server) and TCP port
- **Scaffold starter widgets** (optional) — three pre-wired kits:
  - **Connect / Disconnect** — a `btn_connect` toggle button (Listen→Stop or Connect→Disconnect) and a `lbl_status` label that updates colour and text automatically through `on_connect` / `on_disconnect`
  - **Chat** — a read-only `txt_chat` (Text + scrollbar), a `ent_message` Entry, and a `btn_send` button; sending a message appends `[You] text` to the log; received text appears directly in the log
  - **File Transfer** — a `pb_transfer` Progressbar (updates chunk-by-chunk on both send and receive), a `lbl_file` status label, and a `btn_send_file` button that opens a file picker and sends immediately on a daemon thread

When the **File Transfer** scaffold is active all communication uses a **length-prefix framing protocol** — `struct.pack('>Q', payload_size)` prepended to every message so the receiver knows the exact payload length before reading. Text and binary data share the same wire format; the receiver distinguishes them by attempting UTF-8 decode.

### CommonDialog

A multi-mode wrapper around tkinter's built-in dialog functions. Each handler is independently wired and has its own title / message configuration.

| Handler | Dialog invoked | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `_show_open` ⚡ | `filedialog.askopenfilename` | Path stored in `_cd1_result`; `_on_file_selected` stub called |
| `_show_save` ⚡ | `filedialog.asksaveasfilename` | Path stored in `_cd1_result`; `_on_file_selected` stub called |
| `_show_color` ⚡ | `colorchooser.askcolor` | Color tuple stored in `_cd1_result`; `_on_color_selected` stub called |
| `_show_input` ⚡ | `simpledialog.askstring` | String stored in `_cd1_result`; `_on_input_received` stub called |
| `_show_message` ⚡ | `messagebox` (ok/yesno/warning/etc.) | Button string stored in `_cd1_result`; `_on_message_result` stub called |

**Per-handler configuration** — click **…** on a connected handler row to set that handler's dialog title. For `_show_message`, you also set the message body and messagebox type (ok, okcancel, yesno, warning, error, etc.). All configuration is stored in the component props and written into the generated code.

**`parent=self`** — all dialog calls pass the form as parent so focus returns to the correct window after the dialog closes.

## Canvas Item Designer

The **Canvas Item Designer** (CI mode) lets you place and edit canvas items directly on a `tk.Canvas` widget without leaving the designer.

### Entering and Exiting CI Mode

**Double-click** any Canvas widget on the design canvas to enter CI mode. The designer performs a *sub-form swap*: a synthetic `FormModel` is built from the canvas's `canvas_items` list and loaded into the existing canvas, so all normal designer machinery — select, move, resize, Properties panel, Events tab, undo/redo — works on canvas items for free.

**Exit CI mode** with:
- **Escape** — first press de-arms the active placement tool; second press exits CI mode
- **Right-click on canvas → Exit Canvas Edit Mode**

On exit, the sub-form descriptors are converted back into `CanvasItemDescriptor` objects on the original canvas widget and the full form re-renders.

### Ghost Overlay

While CI mode is active:
- The surrounding form is dimmed with a `gray25` stipple overlay (four rectangles around the canvas area)
- A `#007acc` 2 px border is drawn around the active canvas
- A mode label ("Canvas Edit Mode") is displayed above the border

No transparency tricks are used — the overlay is drawn with stippled canvas rectangles.

### CI Palette

The left palette swaps to show only CI item types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `CanvasRect` | Rectangle with `fill` and `outline` props |
| `CanvasOval` | Oval/ellipse |
| `CanvasText` | Text item with `text` and `font` props |
| `CanvasLine` | Line segment |
| `CanvasImage` | Image item with `image_path` prop |

**Placement modes** match the normal palette: click to arm the placement tool, then click on the canvas to place at default size; drag to set size; double-click to place immediately at the canvas center.

**IMAGES section** — below the item types, an IMAGES panel lists all images associated with this canvas (from Image components where `parent == canvas_id` or `parent == "Global"`):

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| `[+]` | Add images — opens a file picker; copies to `project/images/`; auto-places on canvas at actual PIL dimensions |
| `[-]` | Full-delete the selected image — removes it from the canvas AND from the Image component's `paths` list |
| `[×]` | Clear all images from this canvas |
| Click an image row | Arms the CanvasImage placement tool for that image |
| Double-click an image row | Auto-places the image at the canvas center with PIL dimensions |
| Right-click an image row | Delete menu |
| `▲` / `▼` buttons | Reorder the list |

### Properties and Events Integration

Selecting a CI item loads it into the existing **Properties** and **Events** tabs — no separate panel.

**Properties tab fields:**

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | Readonly — auto-numbered (e.g. `ci_rect1`) |
| `type` | Readonly — item kind |
| `x`, `y` | Position within the canvas |
| `width`, `height` | Item dimensions |
| `tags` | Click to open the tag editor dialog |
| `image_path` | CanvasImage only — click to open an image dropdown |
| `fill`, `outline` | Color picker (rect, oval, line) |
| `text`, `font` | Text items only |

**Events tab** — same wire-and-stub flow as widget events. Supported events: `click`, `dblclick`, `rightclick`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mousemove`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`.

> **Note:** A CI item must have at least one tag assigned before events can be wired. The UI enforces this.

### Tags and the Tag Editors

Tags are what connect canvas items to `tag_bind` calls in generated code — items that share a tag all respond to the same event binding. Tags live in a **per-canvas pool** (stored on the canvas widget as `_canvas_tags`); items then draw their tags from that pool. Two dark-themed dialogs manage this, both canvas-drawn with scrollable hover-highlighted lists:

- **Canvas Tags** (Dialog A) — manages the available-tags *pool* for the canvas: add new tags, remove unused ones. Protected system tags (e.g. `_bg` on a canvas with a background image) appear greyed at the top and can't be removed. The `×` remove button only highlights red when the mouse is directly over it.
- **Item Tags** (Dialog B) — assigns pool tags to specific item(s). A dropdown at the top picks which item to edit (or **All items**); the top list shows the item's current tags (`×` to remove), the bottom list shows pool tags not yet on the item (`+` to add). Typing a new tag and pressing **Enter** adds it to both the item and the pool without closing the dialog. Selecting items on the canvas and in the dropdown stays in sync bidirectionally.

Tag names are validated (no spaces or characters that would break a `tag_bind` call). When wiring a canvas-item event, the Item Tags dialog opens in **wiring mode** — a radio selection of a single pool tag for that event's `tag_bind`. The generated handler is named after that tag, not the item instance — e.g. binding `mousedown` to the `button` tag produces `_button_mousedown` (not `_canvasimage1_mousedown`).

Because the binding belongs to the tag, it **propagates to every item carrying that tag**: once `button → mousedown` is wired on one item, the Events tab of every other item with the `button` tag shows the same handler as a read-only row. The tag is the logical unit, not the individual item — which mirrors runtime, where the single `tag_bind("button", …)` fires for all items tagged `button`.

### Image Component `parent` Property

Image components now have a **`parent`** property (shown as a `canvas_ref` kind dropdown in the Properties panel):

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `None` | Reference only — image is available in code but not auto-placed; not shown in any canvas's IMAGES palette |
| `Global` | Shared by all canvases on the form — appears in every canvas's IMAGES palette |
| `<canvas_id>` | Associated with a specific canvas — appears only in that canvas's IMAGES palette |

When a `CanvasImage` item is placed in CI mode, an Image component is **auto-created** (or updated) on the original form with `parent = canvas_id`. The Image component's `paths` list stays in sync with placed CanvasImage items.

### Code Generation

CI items produce two kinds of generated code in `_build_ui`:

**`tag_bind` calls** — for every `(tag, event)` pair in the canvas items' bindings, deduplicated across items that share a tag:

```python
self.canvas1.tag_bind("my_tag", "<Button-1>",        self._my_tag_click)
self.canvas1.tag_bind("my_tag", "<Enter>",            self._my_tag_enter)
self.canvas1.tag_bind("my_tag", "<ButtonRelease-1>",  self._my_tag_mouseup)
```

**Stub methods** — one stub per unique method name across all bindings:

```python
def _my_tag_click(self, event):
    pass  # TODO

def _my_tag_enter(self, event):
    pass  # TODO
```

Stubs are generated in the `# ── Events ──` section and bodies survive regeneration just like widget event stubs.

**Resize scaling** — canvas items track the canvas through both kinds of resize, whether or not the canvas has a background image:

- *Resized in the designer* — if you resize the Canvas widget after placing items, the generated code places the items at the matching scaled position and size, so the running app looks like the designer.
- *Stretched at runtime* — if the Canvas has a size-changing **anchor** (`all`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`), codegen also emits a `<Configure>` handler that repositions and resizes every item live as the window grows or shrinks. Shapes, lines, and item images scale with the canvas; **text font size and line thickness scale too**, by a uniform factor (the geometric mean of the horizontal and vertical scale, `(_sx * _sy) ** 0.5`) so they grow proportionally on both single- and dual-axis stretches.

### Double-Click Navigation from CI Items

- **Double-click a CI item** (while in CI mode) — auto-generates code if dirty, then jumps to the first handler for that item in the editor
- **Double-click a wired event row** in the Events tab — jumps directly to that handler

Both use the original form's `.py` file path (not the synthetic sub-form name) so navigation lands in the correct file.

---

## Double-Click Navigation

Double-clicking a widget with events:
1. Auto-generates code if the form has ungenerated changes
2. Switches to Editor mode and places the cursor on the first event handler

Double-clicking a widget with no events switches to the Events tab.

**Double-clicking a checked handler row** in the Handlers tab also navigates to that handler (double-clicking an unchecked row enables it instead).

**Double-clicking a wired event row in the Properties panel** (the property name column) also jumps to that handler — so you can navigate to code from any event.

Clicking a menu item on the canvas dropdown navigates to its handler the same way.

## Multi-Form Projects

A project can contain any number of forms. Each form has its own canvas, `.form.json` sidecar, and generated `.py` file.

### Form Types

| Type | Base class | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **Main Window** | `tk.Tk` | The app's primary window |
| **Dialog Window** | `tk.Toplevel` | Secondary windows opened from a main form |

### FORMS Tree

The **FORMS** panel at the top of the left pane shows the full form hierarchy:

- **Main forms** appear at top level with a `⬜` icon
- **Linked dialogs** appear indented below their parent form with a `⧉` icon
- **Unlinked dialogs** appear in a dim "Unlinked" section at the bottom

Click any row to switch the canvas to that form (the current form is auto-saved first). The companion `.py` opens automatically as an editor tab so you can flip between visual and code views without hunting for the file.

**Missing forms** — if a session is restored and a form's `.form.json` can no longer be found on disk, its row is shown in red with a tooltip explaining the missing path. The form can be removed with the right-click menu.

### Set as Main

Designate which form is the app entry point:

- **Right-click** a main form row → **Set as Main**
- **Double-click** a main form row to set it as main directly

When a form is set as main, IDOL:
1. Writes (or overwrites) `main.py` with the standard `from FormName import FormName; FormName().mainloop()` pattern, marked with a `# Generated by IDOL Designer` header
2. Pins that file as the ▶ run entry in the status bar so **Run** always launches the correct form
3. Shows **▶ FormName** in teal in the FORMS panel header

The ▶ indicator in the FORMS panel follows the **active run entry** — if you manually change the run entry selector in the status bar, the indicator updates automatically. In **Active Tab** mode the indicator highlights whichever form corresponds to the currently active editor tab.

### FORMS Tree X Button

- **X on a main form row** — removes that form (and its linked dialogs) from the designer. Shows a confirmation prompt before removing. The underlying `.form.json` and `.py` files are not deleted.
- **X on a linked dialog row** — unlinks the dialog from its parent (removes the link only; does not remove the form from the designer or delete files)

### Session Persistence

The designer state is saved as part of the project session:
- Which forms were open in the designer are restored on next launch
- When a project reopens, linked dialogs load automatically alongside their parent form
- If the designer was active when IDOL last closed, it re-enters designer mode on startup

**Auto-loading linked dialogs** — when you open a form that was created in another directory (via `Designer → Open Form…` or the Explorer right-click menu), IDOL automatically locates and copies both the form's `.form.json` and the `.py` for any linked dialogs it finds in the same source directory, then loads them alongside the parent form.

### Creating a New Form

Click the `+` button in the FORMS header or use `Designer → New Form…`. The dialog has:

- **Form Name** — must be a valid Python identifier; auto-fills as `Form{n}` or `Dialog{n}` (next available number) and toggles between the two prefixes when you flip the Type radio, as long as you haven't typed a custom name
- **Type** — Main Window or Dialog Window; defaults to **Main Window** when the project has no forms yet, otherwise Dialog
- **Link to** — (Dialog only) choose a parent main form or "None (unlinked)"; defaults to the first existing main form

On create, IDOL writes the `.form.json`, generates the `.py` immediately, opens it as an editor tab, refreshes the Explorer, and switches the canvas to the new form.

### Linking and Unlinking Dialogs

**Drag to link** — drag a dialog row and drop it onto any main form row. The target form highlights blue while hovering. A ghost label (`⧉ name`) follows the cursor. Releasing over a form links the dialog to it; releasing elsewhere cancels.

**Unlink** — hover a linked dialog row to reveal a `×` button on the right side. Clicking it removes the link.

A dialog can be linked to multiple main forms simultaneously.

### Dialog Code Generation

Dialogs generate a `tk.Toplevel` subclass. Closing the window calls `_on_close` (a preserved stub) which hides it rather than destroying it, keeping the instance alive for reuse:

```python
class MyDialog(tk.Toplevel):
    def __init__(self, parent, **kwargs):
        # ── IDOL:BEGIN ─────────────────────(Do not modify below)─────────────────────
        super().__init__(parent, **kwargs)
        self.withdraw()
        self.title("My Dialog")
        self.geometry("400x300")
        # ── IDOL:END ───────────────────────(Do not modify above)─────────────────────

        # ── IDOL:BEGIN ─────────────────────(Do not modify below)─────────────────────
        self._build_ui()
        self.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", self._on_close)
        self.focus()
        # ── IDOL:END ───────────────────────(Do not modify above)─────────────────────

    # ── Events ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
    def _on_close(self):
        self.withdraw()
```

The parent main form stores the dialog instance on creation and exposes an opener:

```python
# ── IDOL:DIALOG_IMPORTS:BEGIN ──
from MyDialog import MyDialog
# ── IDOL:DIALOG_IMPORTS:END ──

class Form1(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        # ── IDOL:BEGIN ─────────────────────(Do not modify below)─────────────────────
        super().__init__()
        self.dlg_MyDialog = MyDialog(self)   # created once, reused
        self.focus()
        # ── IDOL:END ───────────────────────(Do not modify above)─────────────────────

    # ── Events ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
    def _open_MyDialog(self):
        self.dlg_MyDialog.deiconify()
```

Key points:
- `self.dlg_MyDialog` gives the parent direct access to the dialog's widgets and state at any time
- `_on_close` and `_open_MyDialog` are both preserved event stubs — customize them freely, bodies survive regeneration
- The `IDOL:DIALOG_IMPORTS` block is fully auto-managed — regenerated from the current link state on every codegen run; do not add your own imports inside it
- **Codegen order** — dialogs are written before main forms so their imports resolve correctly

## Code Generation

**Auto-generation** — code is regenerated automatically 1.5 seconds after any canvas or property change. Rapid edits coalesce into a single run. You can also trigger it manually with `Designer → Generate Code` (`Ctrl+Shift+G`).

```python
import tkinter as tk
# ── IDOL:IMPORTS:BEGIN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Add your imports here
# ── IDOL:IMPORTS:END ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class Form1(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        # ── IDOL:BEGIN ─────────────────────(Do not modify below)─────────────────────
        super().__init__()
        self.title("My App")
        self.geometry("800x600")
        self.result_var = tk.StringVar()
        # ── IDOL:END ───────────────────────(Do not modify above)─────────────────────

        # Your __init__ code here is preserved across regeneration

        # ── IDOL:BEGIN ─────────────────────(Do not modify below)─────────────────────
        self._build_ui()
        # ── IDOL:END ───────────────────────(Do not modify above)─────────────────────

    def _build_ui(self):
        self.btn1 = tk.Button(self, text="Click Me", command=self._btn1_click)
        self.btn1.place(x=10, y=10, width=100, height=30)

    # ── Events ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    def _btn1_click(self, *args):
        pass  # TODO

    # ── Functions ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # Methods defined here are preserved across code generation.
```

## User Code Preservation

Regenerating never discards code you wrote:

- Event handler **bodies** are extracted and spliced back in verbatim, including **leading and trailing comment lines** (comments before the first statement and comments at the end of the body)
- Event handler **signatures** are preserved — change `*args` to `event: tk.Event` once and IDOL keeps it on every subsequent regeneration
- User **imports** between the `IDOL:IMPORTS:BEGIN/END` markers survive regeneration
- The `IDOL:DIALOG_IMPORTS` block is fully auto-managed (always regenerated from link state) — do not add manual imports inside it; use `IDOL:IMPORTS` for your own imports
- Helper methods in the `# ── Functions ──` section survive verbatim
- Code in the two `__init__` user zones (between the IDOL marker blocks) is preserved

## Codegen — No Confirmation Needed

Code generation runs silently — no confirmation dialog. Manual edits to the `.py` are always preserved (event bodies, signatures, helper methods, `__init__` zones), so regeneration is safe to run at any time without prompting.

## Manual Edits Detection

If you edit the generated `.py` by hand, IDOL detects the change via SHA-256 checksum the next time you click Generate Code and warns you. Event handlers, helpers, and `__init__` code are always preserved regardless.

## Persistent Form Model

The canvas state is stored in a `.form.json` sidecar file next to the generated `.py`. The JSON is the source of truth; the `.py` is a build artifact. Both files are version-control friendly.

**Saving the form JSON:**
- `Designer → Save Form` writes all open form JSONs to disk immediately; the menu item is enabled whenever there are unsaved designer changes
- **Exit prompt** — if any form has unsaved changes when you quit IDOL, a dialog asks **Save / Don't Save / Cancel**; choosing Save writes all dirty forms before exiting, Don't Save discards them, and Cancel aborts the exit
- `Designer → Generate Code` also saves the form JSON as a side effect, so generating code always leaves the JSON in sync

## Project Type Gating

The Designer only appears for **Tkinter GUI App** projects. Command Line projects see only the standard editor with no extra UI.

`Pro tip: To open Designer without a project go to Designer -> New Form...`
